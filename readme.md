# Git Mastery Workshop

Welcome to the Git Mastery Workshop! This workshop is designed to help you understand the basics of Git version control and enhance your collaboration skills in software development projects.

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to track changes in your codebase, collaborate with others, and easily manage different versions of your project.

## Requirements

To participate in this workshop, you will need:

- A computer with Git installed (Download: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
- A text editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom)

### Space for conflict
Did you know that you can use `git blame` to find out who last modified each line of a file? Just run `git blame <file>` to see the commit hash and author for each line.
